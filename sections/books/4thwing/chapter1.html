            The characters and the world are introduced.
            Although I got hooked immediately, the first illogical details and obvious plot twists emerged.
            Firstly, after being told multiple times by multiple people to stay away from Xaden Riorson, the son of a rebel who was killed by Violets mom,
            she encounters a man, whom she quickly falls in love with, only to discover, who guessed it, that he is said Xaden.
            Secondly, the trials to become a dragon rider include crossing a stone bridge high up, where 15% of the yearly candidates die.
            The candidate directly in front of Violet, Rhiannon, has trained for the trials her entire life, but shows up with shoes that have flat soles.
            Like how do you manage to observe tens of people dying each year and not thinking:
                "Well maybe in the wet and windy conditions up there, shoes with more grip might be a good idea". Just saying.
            In any case, Violet trades one shoe with her. It obviously is a way to show the Violets selflessness, but come on, there must have been a smarter way of doing that.
