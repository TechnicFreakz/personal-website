            Violet finds her old friend Dain again, who becomes her squad leader.
            Xaden is not her superior, but manages to switch squads so that her squad is in fact under his control.
            Then, the dragons make their first apperance, roasting 3 people, that are "weak", making all cadets realize the severity of the situation
            We also learn more about the "signet", a special magical ability each rider has.
            The general, for example, can apparently see the outcome of every battle before it begins.
            They say this is the reason for him being general, but if you think about it, it does not make that much sense.
            This sounds like a powerful ability, dont get me wrong, but a advisor position would make much more sense in my mind.
            Just knowing HOW something ENDS, does not mean you know HOW to CHANGE said outcome..
