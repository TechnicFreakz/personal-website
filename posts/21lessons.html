      <h3>by Juval Noah Harari</h3>
      <p>
        His third book, after "A brief history of humankind" and "Homo Deus",
        focuses on the present. He condenses the insights he gained from writing
        abut the past and the future as well as discussing all the topics that
        popped up during this journey with colleagues and readers, into 21
        lessons for the present.
